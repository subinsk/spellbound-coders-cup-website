# Online Ideation Phase

## What?

The **Online Ideation Phase** is the first and foundational stage of the
*SpellBound Coders Cup* hackathon.

## Team Formation & Registration {#team-formation-registration}

- Participants can register either **solo** or in **teams of up to 3
  > members**.

- Registration opens on **10th November** and closes on **26th
  > November**.

- A maximum of **50 ideas** will be accepted during this phase to ensure
  > quality and manageability.

- The **20 selected teams** will be invited to participate in the
  > **Hackathon Day** on **4th December**, where they will build and
  > present a working prototype of their idea.

## Submission Requirements

Once registered, each team is required to submit the following:

1.  Presentation Deck (3 slides max -- problem + solution +BMC)

    a.  A well-structured slide deck that outlines the problem
        > statement, the proposed solution, the approach to solving it,
        > and any relevant technical or design considerations.

    b.  This should clearly communicate the innovation, feasibility, and
        > impact of the idea.

2.  **Video Explanation**

    a.  A short video (hosted on a platform like YouTube or Drive) where
        > the team explains their idea in their own words.

| **Evaluation Indicator**                         | **Detailed Description (What Judge Should Look For)**                                                                                                                                              | **Example (From PPT / Video)**                                                                                                                       | Marks |
| **Novelty of Concept**                           | The idea introduces something genuinely new --- not a direct copy of an existing solution. Even if inspired by existing tools, the concept should offer an innovative twist or unique application. | \> "Instead of a generic ride-sharing app, our platform matches users by *shared commute habits* and *verified workplace routes* to improve safety." | 1     |
| **Creative Approach to Solving the Problem**     | The team's approach stands out in *how* they tackle the issue --- either through unusual methods, cross-domain thinking, or clever use of available tools.                                         | \> "We use gamification to make financial literacy engaging for rural youth."                                                                        | 1     |
| **Innovative Use of Technology / Medium**        | The project leverages technology (AI, IoT, blockchain, etc.) in a fresh or unexpected way --- not just buzzword use, but meaningful integration.                                                   | \> "Using computer vision to detect early crop disease through farmers' basic smartphone cameras."                                                   | 1     |
| **Differentiation from Existing Solutions**      | The team clearly explains *how* their idea is better or different --- performance, affordability, accessibility, or design innovation.                                                             | \> "Current waste apps only focus on pickup; ours connects waste sellers directly to local recyclers with instant pricing."                          | 1     |
| **Original Perspective or Reframing of Problem** | The problem is viewed from a unique angle or target group that others often overlook. Creativity in *framing* counts as much as creativity in *solution*.                                          | \> "Instead of tracking students' attendance, our tool helps teachers identify emotional disengagement through speech tone."                         | 1     |
| **Creative Application of Common Tools or Data** | Use readily available resources (APIs, datasets, or hardware) in new ways to deliver extra value.                                                                                                  | \> "We repurpose open Google Maps APIs to predict waterlogging risk during heavy rains."                                                             | 1     |
| **Integration of Multiple Disciplines or Ideas** | The team creatively blends concepts from different fields (e.g., AI + psychology, IoT + education).                                                                                                | \> "Combining sentiment analysis with smart badges to track workplace morale anonymously."                                                           | 1     |
| **Feasibility of Innovation**                    | Innovation is not just theoretical --- the proposed creative element is realistically achievable with current tools, data, or resources.                                                           | \> "We built a low-cost prototype using open-source hardware instead of proposing expensive new devices."                                            | 1     |
| **Potential to Inspire or Disrupt**              | The idea has the potential to redefine current practices or inspire new products or policies, even at an early stage.                                                                              | \> "Our model could enable farmers to lease drones collaboratively, creating shared rural drone fleets."                                             | 1     |
| **Wow Factor --- "Why Didn't I Think of That?"** | The idea makes judges genuinely pause --- elegant simplicity, lateral thinking, or creative leap that clearly improves the user's experience or system efficiency.                                 | \> "An AI model that converts sign language into text *in real time* for video calls --- bridging inclusion directly."                               | 1     |
